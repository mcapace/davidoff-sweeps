Subject: Accessibility Improvements Completed for Davidoff Sweepstakes Website

Dear [Client Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to inform you that we have completed comprehensive accessibility improvements to the Davidoff Sweepstakes website based on the AudioEye accessibility audit results.

## Issues Addressed

We successfully resolved all 8 accessibility issues that were identified in the audit:

### 1. Visual Boundary Contrast (6 instances fixed)
**Issue**: Interactive elements (buttons, form fields) needed stronger visual boundaries for users with visual impairments.

**Solution**: We upgraded all border colors from lighter shades to a darker stone-600 color (#57534e), which provides a 3:1 contrast ratio against white backgrounds as required by WCAG guidelines. This affects:
- All navigation buttons (desktop and mobile)
- All form input fields and dropdowns
- All checkboxes
- All card containers
- All interactive buttons throughout the site

### 2. Link Accessibility (1 instance fixed)
**Issue**: Some links needed clearer descriptions for screen reader users.

**Solution**: We enhanced all link text and added descriptive aria-labels to ensure all links clearly communicate their purpose and destination. For example:
- "View all prize details" instead of "View full prize details"
- Added comprehensive descriptions for all external links
- Standardized all "Official Rules" links with clear descriptions

### 3. Heading Structure (1 instance fixed)
**Issue**: The heading hierarchy needed to follow a logical sequence for screen reader navigation.

**Solution**: We restructured all headings to follow proper HTML hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3 → H4) without skipping levels, ensuring better navigation for users with assistive technologies.

## Additional Improvements

Beyond the specific audit issues, we also implemented:
- Enhanced focus indicators on all interactive elements for keyboard navigation
- Improved button accessibility with proper aria-labels
- Consistent visual boundaries across all interactive elements

## Previous Enhancements (Based on Client Feedback)

We also completed several enhancements based on your earlier feedback:

### Design & Visual Improvements
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Enhanced the overall design with refined glassmorphism effects and improved spacing throughout the site
- **Hero Video Overlay**: Lightened the dark overlay on the hero video to make the video more visible while maintaining text readability
- **Footer Logo**: Increased the footer logo size for better visibility
- **CTA Enhancement**: Added a prominent "Shop Davidoff Accessories" call-to-action button after the prizes section
- **Design Consistency**: Ensured all colors, fonts, and font weights are consistent across all components

### Content & Layout Fixes
- **Prize Text Contrast**: Improved text contrast within prize boxes for better readability
- **Prize List Alignment**: Fixed the alignment of ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) in the prize list for a cleaner appearance
- **Form Field Consistency**: Standardized all entry form field borders and styling for a uniform look

### Privacy & Compliance
- **Cookie Consent Banner**: Implemented a comprehensive cookie consent banner that covers GDPR, CCPA, and other US state privacy laws with granular controls
- **Privacy Policy Page**: Created a detailed privacy policy page covering all data protection requirements

### Product & Asset Updates
- **Image Updates**: Updated product images for the ashtray, cigar case, and Winston Churchill Spirit Glass Set with improved backgrounds and visibility
- **Logo Updates**: Integrated the white Davidoff logo with "Time Beautifully Filled" text for dark backgrounds
- **Video Updates**: Updated the hero video to the new compressed version for better performance

## Technical Details

All changes have been implemented, tested, and deployed to the live site. The improvements maintain the site's visual design while ensuring full compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.

## Next Steps

We recommend running a new accessibility audit after the deployment completes (typically within a few minutes) to confirm all issues have been resolved. The site should now pass the AudioEye accessibility scan with zero issues.

If you have any questions or would like further details about any of these improvements, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
